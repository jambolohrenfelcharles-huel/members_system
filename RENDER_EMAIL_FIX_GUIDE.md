## Environment Variables for Render

Set these in your Render dashboard:

```bash
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USERNAME=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-gmail-app-password
SMTP_FROM_EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_FROM_NAME=SmartUnion
```

## Gmail Setup Instructions

1. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication** on your Gmail account
2. **Generate App Password:**
   - Go to Google Account â†’ Security â†’ App passwords
   - Select "Mail" and "Other (custom name)"
   - Enter "SmartUnion" as the name
   - Copy the generated 16-character password
3. **Use App Password** (not your regular password) for `SMTP_PASSWORD`
4. **Set SMTP_PORT to 587** and **SMTP_ENCRYPTION to 'tls'**

## Testing

### Local Testing
```bash
php test_render_email_fix.php
```

### Render Testing
1. Deploy with environment variables set
2. Visit: `https://your-app.onrender.com/test_render_email_fix.php`
3. Test actual functionality:
   - Forgot Password: `https://your-app.onrender.com/auth/forgot_password.php`
   - Contact Admin: `https://your-app.onrender.com/auth/contact_admin.php`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Failed to send email"**
   - **Solution:** Check SMTP credentials in environment variables
   - **Check:** Gmail App Password is correct
   - **Verify:** All environment variables are set in Render dashboard

2. **SMTP timeout errors**
   - **Normal:** This is expected on Render due to network restrictions
   - **Action:** Emails may still be sent despite timeout warnings
   - **Check:** Render logs for actual success/failure

3. **Environment variables not working**
   - **Check:** Variables are set in Render dashboard (not in code)
   - **Verify:** Variable names match exactly (case-sensitive)
   - **Restart:** Render service after setting variables

4. **Debug information not showing**
   - **Normal:** Debug is disabled on Render to prevent output issues
   - **Check:** Render logs for detailed error information
   - **Local:** Debug works normally in local development

### Debug Mode

Debug mode is automatically disabled on Render to prevent output issues. To enable detailed logging:

1. Check Render logs for error messages
2. Look for "Render Email sent successfully" or "Render PHPMailer Error" messages
3. Monitor email delivery success rates

## Performance Optimizations

### Render-Specific Optimizations
- **Timeout:** Reduced to 15 seconds for faster failure detection
- **Retries:** 3 attempts with exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 8s)
- **Output Suppression:** Prevents header issues during email sending
- **Connection Management:** Optimized for Render's network environment

### Reliability Features
- **Auto-retry:** Failed emails are retried automatically
- **Error Logging:** All attempts are logged for debugging
- **Graceful Degradation:** System continues working even if emails fail
- **Environment Detection:** Automatically uses appropriate settings

## Alternative Solutions

If SMTP continues to have issues on Render, consider these alternatives:

### 1. SendGrid (Recommended)
```bash
# Add to environment variables
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your-sendgrid-api-key
```

### 2. Mailgun
```bash
# Add to environment variables
MAILGUN_API_KEY=your-mailgun-api-key
MAILGUN_DOMAIN=your-mailgun-domain
```

### 3. AWS SES
```bash
# Add to environment variables
AWS_SES_ACCESS_KEY=your-aws-access-key
AWS_SES_SECRET_KEY=your-aws-secret-key
AWS_SES_REGION=us-east-1
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Credentials:** Never hardcode SMTP credentials in code
2. **Environment Variables:** Use Render's environment variable system
3. **App Passwords:** Use Gmail App Passwords, not regular passwords
4. **HTTPS:** All email links use HTTPS on Render
5. **Input Validation:** All email addresses are validated before sending

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Email Delivery Monitoring
- Check Render logs regularly for email success/failure rates
- Monitor SMTP timeout frequency
- Track retry attempt patterns

### Performance Monitoring
- Monitor email sending duration
- Track success rates over time
- Identify peak usage patterns

### Maintenance Tasks
- Regularly update Gmail App Passwords
- Monitor SMTP provider status
- Update email templates as needed

## Conclusion

The Render email fix provides a robust, reliable email system that:

- âœ… **Automatically detects** Render environment
- âœ… **Optimizes settings** for Render's network
- âœ… **Handles failures gracefully** with retry logic
- âœ… **Provides detailed logging** for debugging
- âœ… **Works reliably** in production environment

Your email functionality should now work consistently on Render deployment! ðŸŽ‰
